Duktape
=======

[Duktape](http://www.duktape.org/) is an **embeddable Javascript** engine,
with a focus on **portability** and **compact** footprint.

Duktape is easy to integrate into a C/C++ project: add `duktape.c` and
`duktape.h` to your build, and use the Duktape API to call Ecmascript
functions from C code and vice versa.

Main features:

* Embeddable, portable, compact
* Ecmascript E5/E5.1 compliant
* Built-in regular expression engine
* Built-in Unicode support
* Minimal platform dependencies
* Combined reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection with finalization
* Liberal license
