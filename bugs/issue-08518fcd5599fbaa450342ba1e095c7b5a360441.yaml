    Fixed by adding DUK_OPT_NO_MS_STRINGTABLE_RESIZE.  Just calling recheck_hash_size()
    is not that useful: it is called on every string intern anyway, and the stringtable
    resize happens almost at the end of mark-and-sweep so doing it earlier than the next
    intern is probably not that useful.
