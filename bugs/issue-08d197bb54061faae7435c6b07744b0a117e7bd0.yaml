title: embed LICENSE.txt and AUTHORS.txt into autogenerated duktape.c and duktape.h to make usage easier
desc: |-
  For example, if a project embeds duktape.c and duktape.h into their source
  directory, they'd need to put LICENSE.txt (and AUTHORS.txt) there too.  But
  the same directory might already contain another license file, so the Duktape
  files need to be renamed (e.g. duktape-LICENSE.txt).  But then duktape.c and
  duktape.h will refer to incorrect file names.
  
  If duktape.c and duktape.h contained license/author information appropriate
  at the time of release, this issue would be avoided entirely.
  
  Escape non-ASCII characters when embedding, to keep source files in ASCII.
