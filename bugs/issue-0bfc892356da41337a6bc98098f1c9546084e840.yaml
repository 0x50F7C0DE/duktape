title: finish Unicode case conversion support
desc: |-
  There is currently no way to set the current locale/language, which affects
  e.g. case conversion.  For instance, the lowercase conversion of U+0307 is
  language specific, while the lowercase conversion of U+03A3 is context (but
  not language) specific.  Add a mechanism for setting these, and add test cases
  to cover the different cases.
