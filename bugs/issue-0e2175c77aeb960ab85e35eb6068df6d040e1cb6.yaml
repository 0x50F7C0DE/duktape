    Perhaps having the 'stack' setter be a no-op is a good solution after all
    (although it differs from V8 behavior).  User can still override the setter
    explicitly using Object.defineProperty().
    
    The same logic could be applied to fileName and lineNumber getters.  All
    of these (stack, fileName, lineNumber) could share the same setter which
    just silently returns.
