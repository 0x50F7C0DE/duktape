title: add INTERNAL flag for all strings with \xFF prefix (not just built-ins)
desc: |-
  Otherwise user strings with \xFF prefix are not treated as internal,
  except when the user happens to use a string which Duktape also uses
  as an internal property (the string is then pre-interned by heap init!).
  
  Currently only heap init sets the internal flag.  This change would mean
  moving the flag to string interning.
