title: compiler SETTEMP() does not update temp_max
desc: |-
  This has the side effect that if a SETTEMP() happens to be the highest value
  ever used, temp_max may be too low.
  
  This causes e.g. the bug: test-dev-bug-func-nargs-nregs.js.
  
  The fix is to either change SETTEMP() to update temp_next and check whether
  temp_max also needs to be bumped (which changes all SETTEMP() inline code
  to calls, with some code expansion), or all SETTEMP() locations need to be
  checked whether they need an explicit check for temp_max.

    Fixed by adding SETTEMP_CHECKMAX() which is used only during pass 2
    argument setup code.
