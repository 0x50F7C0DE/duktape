    Currently JSONX and JSONC support can be compiled in (or leaved out) separately.
    This makes a shared helper impossible for now.
    
    If JSONX/JSONC is changed to come as a package (both or neither) then this can
    be fixed.

  - Now handled by Duktape.enc() and Duktape.dec(), issue is irrelevant now.
