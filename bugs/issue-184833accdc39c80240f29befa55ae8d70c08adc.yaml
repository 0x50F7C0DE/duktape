title: implement proper number parsing
desc: |-
  There are a few parsing placeholders now: ToNumber() coercion, parseInt(),
  parseFloat(), etc.  These need to be fixed so that the exactness requirements
  of the specification are fulfilled.
  
  If it's possible to do a compliant parser using ANSI C / C99, it is preferable
  to do that by default.  A fallback manually implemented parser still needs to
  exist for environments with poor ANSI C compatibility.

    Also eliminate the last sscanf() in duk_js_ops.c, for string-to-array-index
    conversion.

    There are still a lot sprintf/snprintf/vsnprintf dependencies in the
    implementation -- however, these are only for formatting strings and
    integers, no floats or doubles now.
