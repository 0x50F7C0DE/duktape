title: implement proper number parsing
desc: |-
  There are a few parsing placeholders now: ToNumber() coercion, parseInt(),
  parseFloat(), etc.  These need to be fixed so that the exactness requirements
  of the specification are fulfilled.
  
  If it's possible to do a compliant parser using ANSI C / C99, it is preferable
  to do that by default.  A fallback manually implemented parser still needs to
  exist for environments with poor ANSI C compatibility.
