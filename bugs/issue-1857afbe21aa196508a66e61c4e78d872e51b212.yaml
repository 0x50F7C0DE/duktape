title: allow user code to plug in local time / timezone helpers to Date built-in at run time
desc: |-
  User could implement nice functions for converting between local
  and UTC time, and to format and parse local time values.  These
  could be registered to the Date implementation (perhaps through the
  __duk__ built-in) at run-time, to change the Date built-in behavior.
  
  This would be nice in that the Date built-in didn't need to provide
  all the platform / environment specific functionality at build time,
  and might be easier for the caller than replacing several Date
  functions with replacements.
