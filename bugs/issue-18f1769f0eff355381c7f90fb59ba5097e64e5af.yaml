title: add some common test case helpers
desc: |-
  For example:
  
  * Many test cases use a wrapper which does try-catch and then prints
    out either error 'name' or full error message (if error is unexpected).
    This can be shortened by a helper with a function argument.
  
  * Many string test cases would benefit from safe printing of strings,
    either as a plain codepoint list, or using ASCII only escaping for
    non-printable characters.
  
  * Getting and printing property descriptors.
  
  * Printing values with explicit type information, implementation independent
    printing of functions (e.g. print "function name=X"), etc.
  
  Some of these helpers could be added to some shared helper object.
  Others could naturally go into prototypes; for instance:
  
    print("foo\u1234bar".toCodePointString());
    "foo\u1234bar".printCodePoints();
