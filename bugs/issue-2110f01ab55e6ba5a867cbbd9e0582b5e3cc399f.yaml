title: remove eval() limitation requiring that a caller activation exists
desc: |-
  This normally has little effect, but if eval() is called from C code with an empty
  value stack, a TypeError is now thrown.
  
  This was seen in practice e.g. with the eventloop example where eval.bind()
  was used to create a callback function which was then called from C code.
