title: "make distributable source two files: duktape.c, duktape.h ?"
desc: |-
  Distributable could include both combined and individual sources.  Combined
  source would be convenient for some projects while separate sources would be
  better for others (e.g. applying patches is nicer with individual files).
  
  The combined file should provide #line directives to keep line/file mapping
