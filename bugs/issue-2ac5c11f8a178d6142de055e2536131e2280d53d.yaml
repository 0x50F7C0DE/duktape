title: reduce the size of large testcase expect blocks
desc: |-
  For instance, brute force conversion tests now have megabytes of expect data.
  This data could be replaced e.g. by a series of result hashes / checksums
  computed for large input range blocks.
  
  This reduces the test case size considerably, but makes debugging more
  difficult.  This is less of a problem if the test case already passes and
  only serves as a regression test case.
