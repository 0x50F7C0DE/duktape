title: Ecmascript API to compact an object
desc: |-
  This is useful when application is Duktape-specific (or Duktape-aware) and
  wants to compact objects directly from Ecmascript.  This can already be done
  if an object is sealed or frozen, but it would also be nice to without sealing
  or freezing.
