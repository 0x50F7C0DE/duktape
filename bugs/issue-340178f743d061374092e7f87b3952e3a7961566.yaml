    PowerPC linux might be a good choice.  There is a 'pearpc' emulator which can run
    Linux.  Also UAE is a big endian environment but is has compiler challenges not
    related to big endian.

    PearPC / qemu-system-ppc didn't work well on Ubuntu.  qemu-system-sparc seems
    to work better and sparc is also big endian.

    Settled on MIPS environment for now, with prebuilt image:
