title: add a place to store global / thread specific values only visible to C code
desc: |-
  Sometimes C code needs to store state that is only accessible from Duktape/C
  code but is still reachable from GC point of view.  For instance, an event
  loop implementation needs to store timer state, active timers, etc, and may
  want to isolate these from Ecmascript code.
  
  One simple solution would be to use an internal property on the global object
  and the Thread instances to do this.  There would then be a Duktape API call
  to push the global or thread specific hidden object into the value stack to
  operate on it::
  
    duk_push_global_store();
    ...
  
    duk_push_thread_store();
    ...
