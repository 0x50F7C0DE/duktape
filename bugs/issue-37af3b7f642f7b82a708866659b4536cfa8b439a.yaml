title: implement first version of Date built-in
desc: |-
  The first version must be Ecmascript compliant, but does not need to be
  optimized yet.
  
  The E5/E5.1 is quite loose in specifying many aspects of Date behavior.
  For instance:
  
  * Date parsing must handle an ISO 8601 subset, but can also parse anything
    else; strict compliance does not require anything else, but real world
    compatibility might.
  
  * String-formatting is implementation defined (even for non-locale-specific
    formats).  Strict compliance does not require anything particular, but
    real world compatibility might.
  
  The "real world requirements" need separate investigation after the initial
  implementation is complete (separate issues should be opened).
  
  The initial implementation should rely on a minimal number of platform
  mechanisms (like locales).  These can serve as a baseline even if locale
  specific formatting is added later.
