    Logger name automatic detection would suffer from tail calls.  However,
    because logger creation uses a constructor call there is no problem:
    constructor calls currently block tail call handling.
    
    Similarly, the 'caller' non-standard property would not work properly
    with tail calls.  But that feature disables tail calls altogether now,
    so this problem won't be triggered.
    
    So, at the moment there are no known issues to document.
