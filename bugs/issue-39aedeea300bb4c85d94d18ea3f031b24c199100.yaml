    All places using DUK_PANIC() could actually use a DUK_FATAL(heap) instead,
    except for assertions.
    
    Perhaps keep DUK_PANIC() only for assertions and convert everything else to
    use DUK_FATAL().  That way the release build would never use the panic
    mechanism, simplifying public API.  Assertions could also be converted to
    always take a heap reference, but this would be quite tedious.

    Changed so that DUK_PANIC() is only used by assertions and the default
    fatal error handler.  The only reason Duktape throws fatal errors now
    is for uncaught errors.
    
    If the user defines a fatal error handler and runs a non-assertion
    build, DUK_PANIC() never gets called.
