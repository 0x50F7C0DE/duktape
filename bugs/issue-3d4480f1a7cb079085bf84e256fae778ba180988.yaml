title: move testcase knownissue status to an external file?
desc: |-
  The known issue status of a test case changes when bugs are fixed and introduced,
  and it's tedious diff on the test case itself.  The other test case metadata is
  more static; e.g. if a testcase tests for non-standard real world behavior, that
  fact doesn't change often.
  
  A single knownissues file would be more easier to maintain and would also provide
  a more concise description of still open issues.
