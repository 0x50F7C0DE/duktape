title: remove 64-bit arithmetic from mandatory code as a portability issue
desc: |-
  It seems that at least VBCC on AmigaOS has trouble with 64-bit integers
  (even though it is striving for C99 compliance).  This turned out in
  duk_numconv.c.

    There are a few places where 64-bit quantities are used:
    
    * duk_numconv.c uses uint64_t for bigint arithmetic
    
    * duk_tval.h used unsigned long long for working with doubles
    
    * duk_util_hashprime.c uses unsigned long long for hash ratio stuff
    
    * RDTSC timestamps are unsigned long long, but this can be disabled
      and is only relevant for debug builds anyway
