title: add a (non-standard) __proto__ or perhaps Duktape.proto() to write internal prototype
desc: |-
  This is relied on by some code and is relatively easy to add.
  
  The downside is that it'll then be possible to create prototype loops from
  user code quite easily, which was previously not possible.
