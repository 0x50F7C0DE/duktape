title: fix O(n^2) inner function parsing
desc: |-
  The problem is that even if we didn't want to compile an inner function,
  we'd need an effective method of skipping it on the second pass of the
  function being compiled.
  
  A simple solution would be to store a lexer offset after the inner
  function is parsed on the first pass.  On the second pass, this offset
  would then be used to skip the function.
