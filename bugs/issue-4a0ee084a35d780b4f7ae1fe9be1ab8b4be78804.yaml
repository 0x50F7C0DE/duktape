title: "Proxy: set/deleteProperty cannot appear to succeed with interacting with target?"
desc: |-
  If set/deleteProperty returns false, it will also cause the property set/delete
  to return false (i.e. fail).  Apparently there is no way to return true (i.e.
  succeed) without also modifying the target object?

    Not actually so.  The post-hook semantics only apply if the target object has
    non-configurable conflicting properties.  It's easy to arrange the proxy methods
    so that the target object has no such properties (e.g. has no properties at all).
