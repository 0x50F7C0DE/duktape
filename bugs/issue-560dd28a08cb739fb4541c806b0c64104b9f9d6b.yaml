title: check String.prototype.replace() RegExp semantics
desc: |-
  The current interpretation is that RegExp matching is done in the same
  process as replacer function calls, which exposes lastIndex to the
  replacer and even allows the replacer to interfere with the matching
  process.
  
  The E5.1 requirements can also be read to indicate that all matches are
  first found into some internal temporary value, and the replacement step
  happens only after all matches have been found -- i.e. the RegExp matching
  process is complete and lastIndex has been written to zero by the last
  non-matching exec() call.  V8 seems to follow these semantics, but they
  may be more expensive to implement (larger code footprint of an already
  large function).
  
  See: testcases/test-builtin-string-proto-replace.js.
