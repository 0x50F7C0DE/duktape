title: merge duk_ispec and duk_ivalue in the compiler?
desc: |-
  There could simply be coercions to ensure an intermediate value is a
  reg/const which would resolve binary and unary arithmetic like it does
  now etc.
  
  Not sure if this would actually benefit footprint though, but worth
  checking out.
