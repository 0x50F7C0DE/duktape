title: "string [[GetOwnProperty]] E5.1 correction: not limited to 4G strings"
desc: |-
  See Annex F, affects index handling in E5.1 Section 15.5.5.2.  Current code
  handles indexing in E5 style, but the change isn't really relevant except
  with strings longer than 4G.  This fix is needed when >= 4G character string
  support is added.
