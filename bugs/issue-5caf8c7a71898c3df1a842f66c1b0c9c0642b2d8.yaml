title: merge DUK_HOBJECT_FLAG_SPECIAL_XXX flags into one special flag?
desc: |-
  There are no free flag fields left so it would be nice to make some more space.
  Also, all current special behaviors can be detected based on class or other
  object flags, so a single "has special behavior" flag suffices.
