title: duk_abort() to flag forced exit to a running executor?
desc: |-
  Similar to step limit, this would cause an error ("aborted") to be
  propagated to the top level.  This would provide some more control
  for sandboxing, but only would be useful in multi-threaded environments.
  
  Implementation must carefully avoid threading issues, and the abort flag
  must be volatile.
