title: api for setting the global object
desc: |-
  Currently there is no way to replace the global object with another.
  It would be nice for sandboxing setup to be able to create a fresh
  object, populate it however you wish, and then replace the global
  object.
  
  Needs to be doable from C, perhaps not from Ecmascript.
