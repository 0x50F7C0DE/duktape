title: "'noreturn' attributes for Duktape API calls which don't return (e.g. duk_error_raw, duk_throw)"
desc: |-
  This is a bit awkward to do because there will separate detection for
  these as opposed to the internal noreturn functions.

    Perhaps move the entire DUK_NORETURN() macro to duktape.h, as it is
    almost self-contained.
