title: switch genstrings bitpacking to be more flexible
desc: |-
  The current approach uses a 6-bit lookup table for 7-bit codepoints, and
  fails if there are more than 64 unique codepoints.  This limit was reached
  with JSON stringify() development, so switch to a better encoding.

    The replacement algorithm uses 5-bit code values and a decoder which is
    either in lowercase mode or uppercase mode.  Letters of matching case
    and a few common characters (like '\x00' and '_') are encoded with 5
    bits (the most common case).  See genstrings.py for more info.
