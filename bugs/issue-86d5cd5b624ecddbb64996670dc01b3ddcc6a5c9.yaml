title: memory state visualization
desc: |-
  Create a very basic tool visualize memory state through Duktape debug logs.
  This should be live, so that you can see how memory use looks like while
  you compile and execute programs.
  
  This is useful at least for Duktape development, to see good and bad
  behaviors.
