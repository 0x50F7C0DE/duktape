    This was actually caused by limit debug printing using the %ld/%lu format
    with a (long) or (unsigned long) cast.  These are 32-bit on MinGW64 so
    they printed out wrong but the constants were correct.
    
    Added debug printing of limits with %lf and (double) cast which is not
    exact but shows the magnitude to point out this kind of error.
