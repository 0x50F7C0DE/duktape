    Garbage collection period should be relative to current heap object count and string count,
    or perhaps a byte size estimate of these.  When reference counting is disabled, the interval
    computed from these must be much smaller.  Since the trigger counter is decremented on each
    allocation, object relative (rather than byte relative) trigger count is probably the most
    appropriate.
