    In addition to callstack introspection one would also need the ability to
    get a thread's resumer to be able to enumerate the whole coroutine chain.
    
    Perhaps Duktape.act() should be merged with Duktape.info() into a shared
    function to introspect Duktape values.  For threads, an optional second
    argument could request for a certain callstack entry to be introspected.
    The thread fields could provide the resumer reference.
    
    If this were done, then Duktape.info() array format would probably need
    to be something more verbose and more easily extensible.  Other value
    types also have additional interesting fields from an introspection
    perspective.  For instance, buffer values have a buffer fixed/dynamic
    type and a potential spare.
