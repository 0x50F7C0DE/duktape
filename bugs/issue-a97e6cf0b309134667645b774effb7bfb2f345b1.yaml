title: "compiler: merge duk_reg_t and duk_regconst_t types"
desc: |-
  Make the new type (duk_reg_t?) signed, make const marker 0x40000000UL so
  that negative values can still be used for marker(s).
  
  The downside is that one bit is lost, but this change would reduce the
  casts in the code a lot.
