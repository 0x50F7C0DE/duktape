    One of the hanging cases is:
    
      test-builtin-global-uri-bruteforce.js

    The other hanging case is:
    
      test-numconv-tostring-fastpath.js

    When manually running profile 300 vs. profile 400, it's apparent that
    profile 300 gets slower and slower.  Since profile 300 has no refcounting,
    could this be a garbage collection issue?  Perhaps mark-and-sweeps are
    happening too often?
