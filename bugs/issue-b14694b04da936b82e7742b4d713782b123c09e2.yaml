title: improve Array sorting algorithm
desc: |-
  Fast path for an array object with an array part, as this is the most important case.
  
  Implementing a C recursion limit or guaranteeing an O(log n) recursion depth.
  Currently worst case is O(n).  Although random pivots mean that it is not trivial
  to craft inputs to cause the worst case, it is still possible because the pivot
  randomization is not cryptographic strength.
  
  A sort algorithm with an O(log n) worst case would be more preferable than qsort
  workarounds.
