title: supporting code to print out tracebacks
desc: |-
  Maybe add a single helper which stringifies an error object's "traceback"
  property and/or add separate helpers to e.g. convert PC values to line
  numbers.
  
  From a practical perspective it would be nice if Error prototype would
  define getTraceback() which would return a traceback string.  Perhaps
  the traceback property should be renamed "tracedata" because it is pretty
  cryptic.

    V8 tracebacks are in e.stack:

    Perhaps Error.prototype should have a 'stack' getter property
    which would construct the stacktrace on the fly?
