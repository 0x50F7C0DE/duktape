title: add a shared helper for string char-by-char string transformation
desc: |-
  Such a helper is needed by e.g. escape() which processes individual
  characters, emitting one or more output characters.  There are other
  escape functions with similar semantics, so they could share a helper
  which handles the mechanics of iterating a source string and emitting
  bytes to an output buffer.
  
  Some string transformation functions (like unescape()) need some
  lookahead, so they need a different model.

    There is a beginning of such a helper in duk_builtin_global.c,
    transform_helper().
