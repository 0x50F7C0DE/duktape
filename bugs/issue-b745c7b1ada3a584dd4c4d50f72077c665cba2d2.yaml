    Subheadings with names like "Example" are a problem: should they get some
    odd looking names (like "example", "example_", "example__" etc)?
    
    Cumulating header names to get names like "foo_example", "bar_example"
    would cause very long ID names.
    
    Another approach is to take the given IDs as known names and then use
    automatic numbering underneath.  For instance, if h2 level id is
    "coroutines", the first h3 inside it would be "coroutines_1" and
    the third h4 inside that would be "coroutines_1_3".  These would not be
    stable IDs but wouldn't pollute the ID space randomly.
    
    Finally, headings could have multiple anchors.  They cannot have multiple
    IDs so it's perhaps better to use anchors anyway for autogenerated names.
