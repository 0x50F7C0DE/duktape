title: separate website to its own repo
desc: |-
  There are some dependencies to break first in buildsite.py:
  
  * scrapes duktape.h to get version number
  
  * needs the examples/guide and examples/hello directories for reading
  
  * needs RELEASES.txt
  
  * needs dukweb.js, jquery, and dukweb support files for REPL page
  
  Most (all?) of these can be fixed by cloning the Duktape repo when building
  the website.
  
  Separating the repos also prevents generated HTML documentation from being
  included in the Duktape distributable.  This is perhaps most easily fixed
  by making the duktape repo build a plain distributable, and then add the
  HTML documentation into the final distributable through the website build
  scripts.  In effect, the final distributable would actually be built by the
  duktape website repo scripts.
