title: finalizers in duk_destroy_heap() when only refcounting is enabled
desc: |-
  Currently a few mark-and-sweep cycles are executed before a heap is
  destroyed.  When mark-and-sweep is not enabled, finalizers do not run
  at all on heap destruction.
  
  Perhaps change behavior so that regardless of collection model, run
  finalizers once.  This would require a heap walk separate from the
  mark-and-sweep code (for mark-and-sweep enabled builds), so perhaps
  do this only when mark-and-sweep is disabled (a sort of a "mini mark
  and sweep").
