title: "duk_features: fix expressions like: #if defined(FOO) && (FOO >= XXX)"
desc: |-
  If FOO is not defined, the comparison will be a syntax error, at least on
  some older compilers.
  
  One fix is to nest #ifdefs::
  
    #if defined(FOO)
    #if (FOO >= XXX)
    /* ... */
    #endif
    #endif
  
  This often leads to awkward preprocessor expressions but maybe cannot be
  avoided.
