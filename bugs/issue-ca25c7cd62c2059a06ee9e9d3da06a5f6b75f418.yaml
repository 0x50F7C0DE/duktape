title: user callback for creating a new global context (more flexible than user initjs)
desc: |-
  User InitJS code is not sufficient for many tasks.  For instance, to
  register additional native functions one needs Duktape/C code.  Also,
  to implement proper sandboxing needs more control than what is possible
  with perhaps a few kilobytes of Ecmascript code.
  
  Perhaps allow a user to set a thread init callback?  It could be set
  into the heap stash, which is then shared for all threads in the heap.
