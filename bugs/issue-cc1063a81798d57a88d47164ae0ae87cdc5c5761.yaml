title: support very old compilers with small identifier/define length limits
desc: |-
  One approach is avoid mangling the identifiers in the current codebase and
  instead:
  
  * Ensure public API functions / constants have short enough names so
    that they don't conflict with the compiler limits.
  
  * Use a script to remap identifiers in the codebase, either based on a
    manually created identifier mapping table, running identifiers, or
    some automatic heuristics which still ensure uniqueness.
