title: put a single string with filename+line into tracedata in builds w/o tracebacks
desc: |-
  Current solution is to put an explicit own property fileName and lineNumber
  as own properties when tracebacks are disabled.  Instead of two own properties
  there could be only one property which contained both filename and linenumber
  (e.g. "foo.js:123").  The downside of this is that if there are multiple
  reachable errors with the same filename, more interned string data is generated.
