title: change asserts to checks in internal duk_def_prop_xxx() calls
desc: |-
  There are a few assumptions in the duk_def_prop_xxx() internal calls,
  such as an existing value never being an accessor, and array writes
  having WEC attributes.  Currently the code just asserts for them, so
  that if an existing property is e.g. an accessor, major problems would
  happen if the assumption were invalid in some corner case.
  
  Since the assumptions are not obvious, it's safer to make the assertions
  proper checks so that they'll be properly caught if some call site
  violates them by accident.
