title: compiler step limit (like regexp step limit)
desc: |-
  A simple step limit, perhaps tied to parsed token count, would protect
  against insanely deep nested functions and any bugs where the compiler
  would get stuck.

    Made it a lexer token limit, also affects regexps and catches all compiler loops
    (except those where no tokens are processed).
