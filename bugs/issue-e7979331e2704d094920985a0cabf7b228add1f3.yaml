title: fix zero-size initializer hacks, they are nonportable
desc: |-
  Variable size initializer is preferred.  If it's not available, a zero-size
  initializer is preferred.  Unfortunately they may not work cleanly in some
  old compilers, so we either need to (a) use size 1 initializer or (b) avoid
  the initializers entirely.
  
  There is an active issue in duk_hbuffer.h.
