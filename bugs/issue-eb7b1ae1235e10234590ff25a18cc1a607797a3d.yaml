title: "optimize struct sizes: duk_small_(u)int_t is 32 bits"
desc: |-
  Often a small type will suffice especially on 32-bit platforms.
  For instance, it would be useful to have a type that would be
  16-bit on memory constrained environments (or 8-bit, depending
  on range) but would be an 'int' in non-constrained environments.
  
  The existing C99 types don't cover this case, so a typedef is
  needed.
  
  This kind of type is needed e.g. in the compiler's duk_ispec/duk_ivalue
  and other structures.
