    Seems to require:
    
    * ArrayBuffer class, internal pointer is a Duktape plain (fixed?) buffer.
      This seems straightforward.  A 'byteLength' special property (like
      array 'length') would be useful; however, accessor classes also have
      a 'byteLength' and a 'byteOffset' and these properties cannot be
      magical.
    
    * Typed array view types: Int32Array etc.  To work efficiently, property
      access primitives need to provide fast paths for these.
    
    * DataView view type.
