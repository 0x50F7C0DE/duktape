title: check Throw flags of [[Put]], [[Delete]], [[DefineOwnProperty]]
desc: |-
  Sometimes (most often) the flag is false, sometimes it is dependent on
  the current strictness, and sometimes the flag is true (even for
  non-strict code).
  
  Check all occurrences of Throw-flags in the specification, check that
  the implementation conforms, and add tests to verify the behavior.
  Currently e.g. Array built-ins don't always behave correctly.
