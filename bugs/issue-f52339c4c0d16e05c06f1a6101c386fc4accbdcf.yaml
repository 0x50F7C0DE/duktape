title: bubble accessed keys upwards in property hash table
desc: |-
  When a property needs lookup of the collision chain, try to find a way to
  make it bubble up the chain so further lookups are faster.  Not sure if
  this is easily possible, may require a delete/reinsert for other properties
  or changing the hash algorithm altogether.  Fast property lookups would be
  very useful for e.g. Node.js Buffer / TypedArray method lookups.
