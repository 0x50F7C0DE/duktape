title: macros to declare internal symbols
desc: |-
  Two macros are needed:
  
  * Internal symbol which is file local: essentially 'static':
  
  * Internal symbol which is not file local.  Such a symbol would be 'static'
    in a single-file build, and some compiler specific linkage macro in a
    multiple-file build.
  
  Declaring a non-static symbol non-exported allows a compiler to use an
  arbitrary ABI for the compiled function which may improve parameter
  passing, register allocation, etc.
