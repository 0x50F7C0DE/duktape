    Perhaps add a virtual property 'length' based on 'nargs' value.  If a concrete
    property is written, it could override the virtual property.  This is probably
    needed by built-ins whose 'length' and 'nargs' don't always match.
    
    This would have the side effect that 'length' couldn't be deleted from Duktape/C
    functions.

  - Add an intermediate prototype object so that Function.prototype is not polluted?
