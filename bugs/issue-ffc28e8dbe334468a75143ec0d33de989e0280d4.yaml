title: improve platform detection in headers
desc: |-
  Reconcile detection between duk_features.h and duk_internal.h.  Feature
  macros (e.g. _XOPEN_SOURCE) must be defined before *any* system headers
  are included.  On the other hand, some detection (like endianness) depends
  on system headers.
  
  One alternative is to move feature macro determination from duk_internal.h
  to duk_features.h.  Duk_features.h could do whatever checks are necessary
  and define feature macros, before including any headers needed for further
  platform detection (like endianness headers).  Once complete, duk_internal.h
  could include <stdio.h> and friends.
