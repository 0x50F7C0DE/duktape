/* There was a curious bug where test-bi-date-canceling.js would fail e.g.
 * on 64-bit Ubuntu, gcc-4.8.1, -m32, and no -std=c99.  Some date computations
 * using doubles would be optimized which then broke some corner case tests.
 * The problem goes away by adding 'volatile' to the datetime computations.
 * Not sure what the actual triggering conditions are, but using this on
 * non-C99 systems solves the known issues and has relatively little cost
 * on other platforms.  See bugs/issue-2e9d9c2d761dabaf8136c0897b91a270d1a47147.yaml.
