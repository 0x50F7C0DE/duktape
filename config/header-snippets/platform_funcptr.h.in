 *  Avoiding platform function pointers.
 *
 *  On some platforms built-in functions may be implemented as macros or
 *  inline functions, so they can't be necessarily addressed by function
 *  pointers.  This is certainly the case with some platform "polyfills"
 *  which provide missing C99/C++11 functions through macros, and may be
 *  the case with VS2013 (see GH-17).
