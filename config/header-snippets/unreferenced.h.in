/*
 *  Macro for suppressing warnings for potentially unreferenced variables.
 *  The variables can be actually unreferenced or unreferenced in some
 *  specific cases only; for instance, if a variable is only debug printed,
 *  it is unreferenced when debug printing is disabled.
 *
 *  (Introduced here because it's potentially compiler specific.)
