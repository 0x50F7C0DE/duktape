Duktape 2.3 release notes
=========================

Release overview
================

Main changes in this release (see RELEASES.rst for full details):

* TBD.

* DUK_USE_ALIGN_BY now always defaults to 8 (natural alignment) to avoid any
  potentially unsafe assumptions about compiler behavior for unaligned memory
  accesses and pointers (which may be an issue even on x86).

Upgrading from Duktape 2.2
==========================

No action (other than recompiling) should be needed for most users to upgrade
from Duktape v2.2.x.  Note the following:

* TBD.

* If you're working with a low memory target or any other target where memory
  usage matters, you may want to force DUK_USE_ALIGN_BY to a lower value
  (4 or 1) to reduce memory overhead.  For most targets the memory overhead
  is not important.
