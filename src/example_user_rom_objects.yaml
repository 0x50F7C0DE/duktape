#
#  Example of user-supplied ROM strings and objects
#

# Strings that must be included in ROM.  String data is in a raw format
# where Unicode codepoints U+0000...U+00FF are identified with exact bytes
# in the string.  This allows invalid strings, including internal strings
# to be represented.

# TBD: format to be defined, must be able to:
#
# - Introduce new strings
# - Introduce new objects
# - Modify/replace properties of existing objects
# - Remove existing objects (what to do about dangling refs; remove?)
# - Add new properties to existing objects
#
