name: duk_debugger_pause

proto: |
  void duk_debugger_pause(duk_context *ctx);

summary: |
  <p>Trigger a debugger pause as soon as possible.  In most cases Duktape pauses
  immediately; however if a native call such as a Duktape/C function is in
  progress or no Ecmascript code is currently executing, the pause will be
  triggered the next time Ecmascript bytecode is executed.  This may take some
  time e.g. if the native call in progress is long-running.</p>

  <p>If debugger support has not been compiled in, or if the debugger is not
  attached, the call is a no-op.  This mimics the semantics of the Ecmascript
  <code>debugger</code> statement.</p>

  <div class="note">
  Like all Duktape API calls, this call is not thread safe.  It may be tempting
  to want to trigger a pause from a thread different than one running Ecmascript
  code for the context, but this is unsafe and must be avoided.
  </div>

example: |
  /* In your event loop: */
  if (key_pressed == KEY_F12) {
      duk_debugger_pause(ctx);
  }
