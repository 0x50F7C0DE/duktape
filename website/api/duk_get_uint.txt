[ ... val! ... ]

=summary
<p>Get the number at <code>index</code> and convert it to a C <code>unsigned int</code>
by first clamping the value between [0, UINT_MAX] and then
truncating towards zero.  The value on the stack is not modified.
If the value is a NaN, is not a number, or the index is invalid,
returns 0.</p>

<p>Conversion examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Infinity => 0</li>
<li>-1 => 0</li>
<li>-3.9 => 0</li>
<li>3.9 => 3</li>
<li>UINT_MAX + 1 => UINT_MAX</li>
<li>+Infinity => UINT_MAX</li>
<li>NaN => 0</li>
<li>"123" => 0 (non-number)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
The coercion is different from a basic C cast from <code>double</code> to
<code>unsigned int</code>, which may have counterintuitive behavior for
e.g. NaN values.  The coercion is also different from Ecmascript
<code>ToUint32()</code> coercion because the full range of the native
<code>unsigned int</code> is allowed, which is useful on platforms with a 64-bit
<code>unsigned int</code> type.

printf("unsigned int value: %u\n", duk_get_uint(ctx, -3));
