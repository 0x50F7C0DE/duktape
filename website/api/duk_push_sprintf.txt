[ ... ] -> [ ... str! ]

=summary
<p>Format a string like <tt>sprintf()</tt> (but safely) and push the result
to the value stack.  Returns a non-<tt>NULL</tt> pointer to the resulting
string.</p>

<p>If <tt>fmt</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, an empty string is pushed to the stack
and a non-<tt>NULL</tt> pointer to an empty string is returned (this
behavior mimics what <tt>sprintf()</tt> does for a <tt>NULL</tt> format
string, at least on Linux).  The returned pointer can be dereferenced and a
NUL terminator character is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Unlike <tt>sprintf()</tt> the string formatting is safe.  Concretely,
the implementation will try increasing temporary buffer sizes until a
large enough buffer is found for the temporary formatted value.</p>

=example
duk_push_sprintf(ctx, "meaning of life: %d, name: %s",
                 42, "Zaphod");
