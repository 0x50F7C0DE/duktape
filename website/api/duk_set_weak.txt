[ ... obj! ... ] -> [ ... obj! ... ]

=summary
<p>Set object at <code>index</code> to be weak, so that all its own properties
(including array elements and accessors) are considered weak references.
Property keys and the internal prototype are considered strong references.</p>

<div class="note">
This API call is experimental at present, and some of the semantics may change
or the API call may be replaced with another weak reference implementation.
