<h1 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h1>

<p>This section discussed Duktape compatibility with Ecmascript dialects,
extensions, and frameworks.</p>

<h2>Ecmascript E5 / E5.1</h2>

<p>The main compatibility goal of Duktape is to be Ecmascript E5/E5.1
compatible.  Current level of compatibility should be quite high.</p>

<h2>Ecmascript E3</h2>

<p>There is no effort to maintain
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf">Ecmascript E3</a>
compatibility, other than required by the E5/E5.1 specification.</p>

<h2>CoffeeScript</h2>

<p><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> compiles to
JavaScript which should be compatible with Duktape.  There are no known
compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Some CoffeeScript examples are included in the distributable.  Simply
run <code>make</code> in <code>examples/coffee/</code>.  For instance,
<code>hello.coffee</code>:</p>
<pre class="coffeescript-code">
print 'Hello world!'
print 'version: ' + Duktape.version
</pre>

<p>compiles to:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
(function() {

  print('Hello world!');

  print('version: ' + Duktape.version);

}).call(this);
</pre>

<h2>Asm.js</h2>

<p><a href="http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/">asm.js</a> is a
"strict subset of JavaScript that can be used as a low-level, efficient
target language for compilers".  As a subset of JavaScript it should be
fully compatible with Duktape.  However, Duktape has no specific support
for asm.js and won't optimize asm.js code.  In fact, asm.js code will
generate unnecessary bytecode and execute slower than normal Ecmascript
code.  The <code>"use asm"</code> directive specified by asm.js is ignored
by Duktape.</p>
