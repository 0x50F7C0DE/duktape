<h1 id="custombehavior">Custom behavior</h1>

<p>This section summarizes Duktape behavior which deviates from the E5.1
specification.</p>

<h2>Duktape built-in</h2>

<p>The <code>Duktape</code> built-in is (of course) non-standard and provides
access to Duktape specific features.</p>

<h2>Additional Error and Function object properties</h2>

<p>See
<a href="#errorobjects">Error objects</a> and
<a href="functionobjects">Function objects</a>.</p>

<h2>Function statements</h2>

<p>E5.1 does not allow a function declaration to appear outside program or
function top level:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function test() {
    // point A
    try {
        throw new Error('test');
    } catch (e) {
        // This is a SyntaxError in E5.1
        function func() {
            print(typeof e);
        }
        // point B
    }
    // point C
}
</pre>

<p>These declarations are also referred to as "function statements", and appear
quite often in real world code (including the test262 test suite), so they are
allowed by Duktape.  Unfortunately there are several semantics used by different
Javascript engines.  Duktape follows the V8 behavior for function statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strict function: a SyntaxError is thrown (standard behavior).</li>
<li>Non-strict function: treat a function statement like an ordinary function
    declaration, conceptually "hoisting" it to the top of the function.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an illustration, the above example would behave as the following:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function test() {
    function func() {
        print(typeof e);
    }
 
    try {
        throw new Error('test');
    } catch (e) {
    }
}
</pre>

<p><code>func()</code> in the above example would already be declared
and callable in point A, and would not have access to the <code>e</code>
binding in any of the points A, B, or C.</p>

<h2>RegExp leniency</h2>

<p>Although not allowed by E5.1, the following escape is allowed in RegExp
syntax:</p>
<pre>
  /\$/       /* matches dollar literally, non-standard */
  /\u0024/   /* same, standard */
</pre>

<p>This escape occurs in real world code so it is allowed.  (More leniency
will be added in future versions to deal with real world RegExps; dollar
escapes are not the only issue.)</p>
