<h2 id="errorobjects">Error objects</h2>

<h3>Property summary</h3>

<p>Ecmascript Error objects have very few standard properties, so many
Ecmascript implementations have added quite a few custom properties.
Duktape uses standard Error properties but also borrows the most useful
properties used by other implementations.  The number of "own" properties
of error objects is minimized to keep error objects as small as possible.</p>

<p>Error objects have the following properties (mostly inherited):</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Property name</th><th>Compatibility</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>name</td><td>standard</td><td>Name of error, e.g. <tt>TypeError</tt>, inherited</td></tr>
<tr><td>message</td><td>standard</td><td>Optional message of error, own property, empty message inherited if absent</td></tr>
<tr><td>fileName</td><td>Rhino</td><td>Filename related to error source, inherited accessor</td></tr>
<tr><td>lineNumber</td><td>Rhino</td><td>Linenumber related to error source, inherited accessor</td></tr>
<tr><td>stack</td><td>V8</td><td>Traceback as a multi-line human redable string, inherited accessor</td></tr>
<tr><td>tracedata</td><td>Duktape</td><td>Raw traceback data in an internal format, own property</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If Duktape is compiled with traceback support:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>stack</tt>, <tt>fileName</tt>, and <tt>lineNumber</tt> are accessor
    properties inherited from <tt>Error.prototype</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>tracedata</tt> is an own property of the Error instance which provides
    the raw data (in an internal format) needed by the accessors.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Duktape is compiled without traceback support:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>stack</tt> accessor will be equivalent to
    <tt>Error.prototype.toString()</tt>, so that printing the stacktrace
    always produces a useful result.</li>
<li><tt>fileName</tt> and <tt>lineNumber</tt> will be own properties of the
    Error object.</li>
</ul>

<p>When error objects are created using the Duktape API from C code and the
caller does not give a format string for a <tt>message</tt>, the <tt>message</tt>
property is set to a numeric error code given in the API call.  The type of
<tt>message</tt> will be number in this case; normally error messages are
strings.   In minimized Duktape builds all errors generated internally by
Duktape use numeric error codes only.</p>

<p>An object is considered an "error object" if its internal prototype
chain contains the (original) <tt>Error.prototype</tt> object.  Only
objects matching this criteria get augmented with e.g. traceback data.</p>

<h3>Traceback</h3>

<p>The <tt>stack</tt> property is an accessor (setter/getter) property
which provides a printable traceback related to an error.  The traceback
reflects the call stack when the error object was created (not thrown).
Traceback data is automatically collected and added to an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>when an Error instance is constructed;</li>
<li>when an error is thrown from C code using the Duktape API;</li>
<li>when an error is thrown from inside Duktape.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data used to create the traceback is stored in the <tt>tracedata</tt>
property in an internal and version-dependent format documented in the
Duktape full distribution.  You shouldn't access the <tt>tracedata</tt>
directly.</p>

<p>The exact traceback format is still in flux (and you shouldn't rely on
an exact format in any case).  As an example, the program:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
// shortened from ecmascript-testcases/test-dev-traceback-example.js
try {
    decodeURIComponent('%e1%a9%01');  // invalid utf-8
} catch (e) {
    print(e.stack);
}
</pre>

<p>would print something like:</p>
<pre>
URIError: invalid input
        duk_builtin_global.c:317
        decodeURIComponent (null) native strict
        global ecmascript-testcases/test-dev-traceback-example.js:3
</pre>

<p>In builds where tracebacks are disabled, the <tt>stack</tt> accessor
will return the same value as calling <tt>toString()</tt> on the error
would.  This means you can always print <tt>e.stack</tt> and get a useful
output.</p>

<p>The most portable traceback printing approach is something like:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
try {
    decodeURIComponent('%e1%a9%01');  // invalid utf-8
} catch (e) {
    // Print stacktrace on at least Duktape and V8, or a standard error
    // string otherwise.
    print(e.stack || e);
}
</pre>

<p>Attempt to write to <tt>stack</tt> is silently ignored.  You can still
override the accessor by defining an own property of the same name explicitly
with <tt>Object.defineProperty()</tt>.  This behavior differs from V8 where
<tt>stack</tt> is an own property of the Error instance, and if you assign a
value to <tt>stack</tt>, the value reads back as assigned.</p>

<h3>Current limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are no cause chains in Ecmascript or Duktape.</li>
<li>These is currently no way to access traceback elements programmatically.</li>
<li>If an error is created with a non-constructor function call
    (<tt>Error('msg')</tt> instead of <tt>new Error('msg')</tt>) it
    won't get augmented at the moment.</li>
</ul>
