<h1 id="finalization">Finalization</h1>

<p>Duktape supports object finalization as a custom feature.  A finalizer
is called when an object is about to be freed, so that application code
can e.g. free native resources associated with an object.</p>

<p>An object which has an internal finalizer property in its prototype
chain (or in the object itself) is subject to finalization before being
freed.  The internal finalizer property is set using the <code>Duktape.fin()</code>
method with the object and the finalizer function as call arguments.
The current finalizer is read back by calling <code>Duktape.fin()</code>
with only the object as a call argument.  A finalizer can also be set/get from
C code using the <code>duk_get_finalizer()</code> and <code>duk_set_finalizer()</code>
API calls.  A finalizer can be either an Ecmascript function or a Duktape/C function.</p>

<p>A finalizer is triggered when an unreachable object is detected by
reference counting or mark-and-sweep.  Finalizers are also executed for all
remaining objects (regardless of their reachability status) when a heap is destroyed.
This guarantees that a finalizer gets executed at some point before a heap
is destroyed, which allows native resources (such as sockets and files) to
be freed reliably.</p>

<p>The finalizer function is called with the target object as its sole
argument.  The finalizer may rescue the object by creating a live reference
to the object before returning.  The return value is ignored, and any errors
thrown by the finalizer are silently ignored.  A finalizer may be called
multiple times (this may happen in special cases even when the object is not
rescued by the finalizer).  A finalizer should be careful to avoid e.g.
freeing a native resource twice in such cases.</p>

<p>Finalizers cannot currently yield.  The context executing the finalization
can currently be any coroutine in the heap.  (This will be fixed in the future.)
