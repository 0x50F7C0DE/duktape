<h1 id="finalization">Finalization</h1>

<h2>Overview of finalization</h2>

<p>An object which has an internal finalizer property in its prototype
chain (or in the object itself) is subject to finalization before being freed.
The internal finalizer property is set using <code>Duktape.fin()</code>
method with the object and the finalizer function as call arguments.
The current finalizer is read back by calling <code>Duktape.fin()</code>
with only the object as a call argument.</p>

<p>The finalizer method is called with the target object as its sole
argument.  The method may rescue the object by creating a live reference
to the object before returning.  The return value is ignored; similarly,
any errors thrown by the finalizer are ignored.  The finalizer may be
triggered by either reference counting or mark-and-sweep.</p>

<p>Finalizers cannot currently yield.  The context executing the finalization
can currently be any coroutine in the heap.  (This will be fixed in the future.)
</p>

<!-- FIXME: comment on whether or not finalizers are run multiple times -->

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Finalization example:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
// finalize.js
var a;

function init() {
    a = { foo: 123 };

    Duktape.fin(a, function (x) {
        print('finalizer, foo -&gt;', x.foo);
    });
}

// create object, reference it through 'a'
init();

// delete reference, refcount triggers finalization immediately
print('refcount finalizer');
a = null;

// mark-and-sweep finalizing happens here (at the latest) if
// refcounting is disabled
print('mark-and-sweep finalizer')
Duktape.gc();
</pre>

<p>If you run this with the Duktape command line tool (with the default
Duktape profile), you'll get:</p>
<pre>
$ duk finalize.js
refcount finalizer
finalizer, foo -&gt; 123
mark-and-sweep finalizer
Cleaning up...
</pre>
