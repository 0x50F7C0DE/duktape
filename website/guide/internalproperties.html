<h1 id="internalproperties">Internal properties</h1>

<p>Duktape supports non-standard <b>internal properties</b> which are
essentially hidden from user code.  They can only be accessed by a
direct property read/write, and are never enumerated, serialized by
<code>JSON.stringify()</code> or returned from built-in functions such
as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code>.
Duktape uses internal properties for various implementation specific
purposes (such as storing an object's finalizer reference), but they
can also be employed by user code.</p>

<p>Internal properties are distinguished from other properties by the
property key: if the byte representation of a property key begins with
a <code>0xFF</code> byte Duktape automatically treats the property as an
internal property.  Such a string is referred to as an <b>internal string</b>.
The initial byte makes the key invalid UTF-8 (even invalid extended UTF-8),
which ensures that internal properties never conflict with normal Unicode
property names and ordinary Ecmascript code cannot accidentally access them.</p>

<p>Duktape uses internal properties e.g. for storing an object's finalizer
reference, for storing the underlying primitive value for various objects
(such as <code>Date</code> and <code>Number</code>) and for storing control
properties of function instances.  The current naming convention of
Duktape's internal properties is to follow the <code>0xFF</code> with
an identifier matching <code>[a-z0-9_]+</code> (no uppercase characters).
For instance, the underlying timestamp of a <code>Date</code> is (currently)
stored as the internal property <code>\xFFvalue</code> (byte sequence
<code>ff 76 61 6c 75 65</code>).
Note that this is different from the valid Ecmascript string <code>"\u00ffvalue"</code>
which Duktape would represent internally as the CESU-8 byte sequence
<code>c3 bf 76 61 6c 75 65</code>.  The initial byte is often represented by
an underscore in documentation for readability, e.g. <code>_value</code> is used
instead of <code>\xFFvalue</code>.</p>

<div class="note">
User code should never try to access Duktape's internal properties.  The set
of internal properties used can change arbitrarily between versions.
</div>

<p>User code can also use internal properties for its own purposes, e.g. to
store "hidden state" in objects, as long as the property names never
conflict with current or future Duktape internal property names.
The recommended approach for now is to prefix user internal properties with
two <code>0xFF</code> bytes, e.g. <code>\xFF\xFFmyprop</code> (byte sequence
<code>ff ff 6d 79 70 72 6f 70</code>).  (Note, again, that this is different
from the valid Ecmascript string <code>"\u00ff\u00ffmyprop"</code> which would
be represented as the CESU-8 byte sequence
<code>c3 bf c3 bf 6d 79 70 72 6f 70</code>.)</p>

<p>Creating an internal string is easy from C code:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
/* Create an internal string, which can then be used to read/write internal
 * properties, and can be passed on to Ecmascript code like any other string.
 */
duk_push_string(ctx, "\xff\xffmyprop");
</pre>

<p>Internal strings can also be created from Ecmascript code if one has access
to e.g. the Buffer constructor or <code>Duktape.dec()</code> (this must be considered
in sandboxing):</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
// Using Duktape.Buffer()
var buf = new Duktape.Buffer(2);
buf[0] = 255; buf[1] = 255;
var key1 = buf + 'myprop';

// Using Duktape.dec()
var key2 = Duktape.dec('hex', 'ffff6d7970726f70');  // \xFF\xFFmyprop
</pre>

<p>There's no special access control for internal properties: if user code has
access to the property name (string), it can read/write the property value.
Any code with the ability to create or use buffers can potentially create an
internal string by converting a buffer into a string.  However, standard Ecmascript
code with no access to buffer values or ability to create them cannot create internal
strings (or any invalid UTF-8 strings in general).  When sandboxing, ensure that
the sandboxed code has no access to the <code>Duktape</code> built-in or any
buffer values.</p>

<p>As a concrete example, the internal value of a <code>Date</code> can be
accessed as follows:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
// Print the internal timestamp of a Date instance.  User code should NEVER
// actually do this because the internal properties may change between
// versions in an arbitrary manner!

var key = Duktape.dec('hex', 'ff76616c7565');  // \xFFvalue
var dt = new Date(123456);
print('internal value is:', dt[key]);  // prints 123456
</pre>
