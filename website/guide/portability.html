<h3>Platforms and compilers</h3>

<p>The table below summarizes the platforms and compilers which Duktape is known
to work on, with portability notes where appropriate.  This is not a list of
supported platforms, rather a list of what is known to work.</p>

<h3>Using C++ instead of C</h3>

<p>There are two ways to use Duktape in a C++ program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile Duktape in plain C, and use it from a C++ program.  The
    <tt>duktape.h</tt> header provides the necessary glue to avoid name
    mangling issues.</li>
<li>Compile both Duktape and your program as C++..</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <tt>int</tt> type is assumed to be 32 bits.  This is incorrect even
    on some platforms which provide a 32-bit type.</li>
</ul>
