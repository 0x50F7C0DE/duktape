<p>The table below summarizes the platforms and compilers which Duktape is known
to work on, with portability notes where appropriate.  This is <b>not an exhaustive
list</b> of supported/unsupported platforms, rather a list of what is known to work
(and not to work).  Platform and compiler specific issues are discussed in more

<h3>Clang</h3>

<p>Clang 3.3 on FreeBSD has some aliasing issues (at least) when using
<code>-m32</code> and when Duktape ends up using a packed <code>duk_tval</code>
value representation type.  You can work around the problem by defining
<code>DUK_OPT_NO_PACKED_TVAL</code> to disable packed value type.  The
problem does not appear in all clang versions.  Duktape self tests cover
this issue (define <code>DUK_OPT_SELF_TESTS</code> when compiling).
See internal test file <code>misc/clang_aliasing.c</code>.</p>

<h3>TCC</h3>

<p>TCC has zero sign handling issues; Duktape mostly works but zero sign is
not handled correctly.  This results in Ecmascript non-compliance, for
instance <code>1/-0</code> evaluates to <code>Infinity</code>, not <code>-Infinity</code>
as it should.</p>

<h3>VBCC (AmigaOS / TOS)</h3>

<p>VBCC doesn't appear to provide OS or processor defines.  To compile for
M68K AmigaOS or TOS you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define <code>__MC68K__</code> manually.</li>
<li>Define either <code>AMIGA</code> or <code>__TOS__</code> manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Datetime resolution is limited to full seconds only when using VBCC on
AmigaOS or TOS.</p>

<h2>Using Duktape from a C++ program</h2>

<p>To use Duktape from a C++ program, simply compile Duktape in plain C and use
<code>duktape.h</code> normally in your C++ program; <code>duktape.h</code>
contains the necessary glue to make this work.  Specifically, it contains
<code>extern "C" { ... }</code> to avoid name mangling issues.</p>

<p>Currently Duktape itself cannot be compiled in C++ mode.  This is under
work but is not a trivial issue because many of the compiler defines and
headers are different (especially for pre C99/C++11).</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>int</code> type is assumed to be at least 32 bits.  This is
    incorrect even on some platforms which provide a 32-bit type.</li>
<li>Pointer less-than/greater-than comparisons are expected to work like
    pointers were unsigned.  This is incorrect on some platforms.</li>
<li>On platforms requiring aligned accesses, Duktape guarantees 4-byte
    alignment.  In particular, 64-bit integers and IEEE double values are
    not guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned.  This is not always correct.</li>
</ul>
