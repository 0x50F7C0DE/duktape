<p><b>(This section is under work.)</b></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Programming with Duktape is quite straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Duktape source (<code>duktape.c</code>) and header (<code>duktape.h</code>)
    to your build.</li>
<li>Create a Duktape <b>heap</b> (a garbage collection region) and an initial
    <b>context</b> (essentially a thread handle) in your program.</li>
<li>Load the necessary Ecmascript script files, and register your Duktape/C
    functions.  Duktape/C functions are C functions you can call from
    Ecmascript code for better performance, bindings to native libraries, etc.</li>
<li>Use the Duktape API to call Ecmascript functions whenever appropriate.
    Duktape API is used to pass values to and from functions.  Values are
    converted between their C representation and the Duktape internal
    (Ecmascript compatible) representation.</li>
<li>Duktape API is also used by Duktape/C functions (called from Ecmascript)
    to access call arguments and to provide return values.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at all the steps and their related concepts in more detail.</p>

<h3>Heap and context</h3>

<p>A Duktape <b>heap</b> is a single region for garbage collection.  A heap
is used to allocate storage for strings, Ecmascript objects, and other
variable size, garbage collected data.  Objects in the heap have an internal
heap header which provides the necessary information for reference counting,
mark-and-sweep garbage collection, object finalization, etc.
Heap objects can reference each other, creating a reachability graph from
a garbage collection perspective.  For instance, the properties of an Ecmascript
object reference both the keys and values of the object's property set.  You can
have multiple heaps, but objects in different heaps cannot reference each other
directly; you need to use serialization to pass values between heaps.</p>

<p>A Duktape <b>context</b> is an Ecmascript "thread of execution" which lives
in a certain Duktape heap.  A context is represented by a <code>duk_context *</code>
in the Duktape API, and is associated with an internal Duktape coroutine (a form
of a co-operative thread).  The context handle is given to almost every Duktape
API call, and allows the caller to interact with the <b>value stack</b> of the
Duktape coroutine: values can be inserted and queries, functions can be called,
and so on.</p>

<p>Each coroutine has a <b>call stack</b> which controls execution, keeping
track of function calls, native or Ecmascript, within the Ecmascript engine.
Each coroutine also has a <b>value stack</b> which stores all the Ecmascript
values of the coroutine's active call stack.  The value stack always has an
active <b>stack frame</b> for the most recent function call (when no function
calls have been made, the active stack frame is the value stack as is).
The Duktape API calls operate almost exclusively in the currently active
stack frame.  A coroutine also has an internal <b>catch stack</b> which is used
to track error catching sites established using e.g. <code>try-catch-finally</code>
blocks.  This is not visible to the caller in any way at the moment.</p>

<p>Multiple contexts can share the same Duktape <b>heap</b>.  In more concrete
terms this means that multiple contexts can share the same garbage collection
state, and can exchange object references safely.  Contexts in different heaps
cannot exchange direct object references; all values must be serialized in one
way or another.</p>

<p>Almost every API call provided by the Duktape API takes a context pointer
as its first argument: no global variables or states are used, and there are
no restrictions on running multiple, independent Duktape heaps and contexts
at the same time.  There are multi-threading restrictions, however: only one
native thread can execute any code within a single heap at any time.</p>

<p>To create a Duktape heap and an initial context inside the heap, you can
simply use:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_context *ctx = duk_create_heap_default();
if (!ctx) { exit(1); }
</pre>

<p>If you wish to provide your own memory allocation functions and a fatal
error handler function (recommended), use:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_context *ctx = duk_create_heap(my_alloc,
                                   my_realloc,
                                   my_free,
                                   my_udata,
                                   my_fatal);
if (!ctx) { exit(1); }
</pre>

<p>To create additional contexts inside the same heap:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_context *new_ctx;

(void) duk_push_thread(ctx);
new_ctx = duk_get_context(ctx, -1 /*index*/);
</pre>

<p>Contexts are automatically garbage collected when they become unreachable.
This also means that if your C code holds a <code>duk_context *</code>, the
corresponding Duktape coroutine MUST be reachable from a garbage collection
point of view.</p>

<p>A heap must be destroyed explicitly when the caller is done with it:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_destroy_heap(ctx);
</pre>

<p>This frees all heap objects allocated, and invalidates any pointers to
such objects.  In particular, if the calling program holds string pointers
to values which resided on the value stack of a context associated with the
heap, such pointers are invalidated and must never be dereferenced after
the heap destruction call returns.</p>

<h3>Call stack and catch stack (of a context)</h3>

<p>The call stack of a context is not directly visible to the caller.
It keeps track of the chain of function calls, either C or Ecmascript,
currently executing in a context.  The main purpose of this book-keeping is
to facilitate the passing of arguments and results between function callers
and callees, and to keep track of how the value stack is divided between
function calls.  The call stack also allows Duktape to construct a traceback
for errors.</p>

<p>Closely related to the call stack, Duktape also maintains a catch stack
for keeping track of current error catching sites established using e.g.
<code>try-catch-finally</code>.  The catch stack is even less visible to the
caller than the call stack.</p>

<p>Because Duktape supports tail calls, the call stack does not always
accurately represent the true call chain: tail calls will be "squashed"
together in the call stack.</p>

<div class="note">Don't confuse with the C stack.</div>

<h3>Value stack (of a context) and value stack index</h3>

<p>The value stack of a context is an array of tagged type values related
to the current execution state of a coroutine.  The tagged types used are:
<code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, boolean, number, string, object, buffer,
and pointer.  For a detailed discussion of the available tagged types, see
<a href="#types">Types</a>.</p>

<p>The value stack is divided between the currently active function calls
(activations) on the coroutine's call stack.  At any time, there is an active
stack frame which provides an origin for indexing elements on the stack.
More concretely, at any time there is a <b>bottom</b> which is referred
to with the index zero in the Duktape API.  There is also a conceptual
<b>top</b> which identifies the stack element right above the highest
currently used element.  The following diagram illustrates this:</p>
<pre>
 Value stack
 of 10 entries
 (absolute indices)

.----.
| 15 |
| 14 |
| 13 |
| 12 |      Active stack frame (indices
| 11 |      relative to stack bottom)
| 10 |
|  9 |      .---.
|  8 |      | 5 |   API index 0 is bottom (at value stack index 3).
|  7 |      | 4 |
|  6 |      | 3 |   API index 5 is highest used (at value stack index 8).
|  5 |      | 2 |   
|  4 |      | 1 |   Stack top is 6 (relative to stack bottom).
|  3 | &lt;--- | 0 |
|  2 |      `---'
|  1 |
|  0 |
`----'
</pre>

<p>There is no direct way to refer to elements in the internal value stack:
Duktape API always deals with the currently active stack frame.  Stack frames
are shown horizontally throughout the documentation for space reasons.  For
example, the active stack frame in the figure above would be shown as:</p>
<pre class="stack">
[ 0 1 2 3 4 5 ]
</pre>

<p>A <b>value stack index</b> is a signed integer index used in the Duktape
API to refer to elements in currently active stack frame, relative to the
current frame bottom.</p>

<p>Non-negative (&gt;= 0) indices refer to stack entries in the
current stack frame, relative to the frame bottom:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ 0 1 2 3 4 5! ]
</pre>

<p>Negative (&lt; 0) indices refer to stack entries relative to the top:</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1! ]
</pre>

<p>The special constant <code>DUK_INVALID_INDEX</code> is a negative integer
which denotes an invalid stack index.  It can be returned from API calls
and can also be given to API calls to indicate a "no value".</p>

<p>The <b>value stack top</b> (or just "top") is the non-negative index of
an imaginary element just above the highest used index.  For instance, above
the highest used index is 5, so the stack top is 6.  The top indicates the
current stack size, and is also the index of the next element pushed to the
stack.</p>

<pre class="stack">
[ 0 1 2 3 4 5! 6? ]
</pre>

<div class="note">
<p>API stack operations are always confined to the current stack frame.
There is no way to refer to stack entries below the current frame.  This
is intentional, as it protects functions in the call stack from affecting
each other's values.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">Don't confuse with the C stack.</div>

<h3>Growing the value stack</h3>

<p>At any time, the value stack of a context is allocated for a certain
maximum number of entries.  An attempt to push values beyond the allocated
size will cause an error to be thrown, it will <b>not</b> cause the value
stack to be automatically extended.  This simplifies the internal
implementation and also improves performance by minimizing reallocations
when you know, beforehand, that a certain number of entries will be needed
during a function.</p>

<p>When a value stack is created or a Duktape/C function is entered, the
value stack is always guaranteed up to size XXX.  In the typical case this
is more than sufficient so that the majority of Duktape/C functions don't
need to extend the value stack.  Only functions that need more space or
perhaps need an input-dependent amount of space need to grow the value
stack.</p>

<p>You can extend the stack allocation explicitly with <code>duk_check_stack()</code>
or (usually more preferably) <code>duk_require_stack()</code>.  Once successfully
extended, you are again guaranteed that the specified number of elements can
be pushed to the stack.  There is no way to shrink the allocation except by
returning from a Duktape/C function.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, the following function which will uppercase an
input ASCII string by pushing uppercased characters one-by-one on the stack
and then concatenating the result.  This example illustrates how the number
of value stack entries required may depend on the input (otherwise this is
not a very good approach for uppercasing a string):</p>

<pre class="ecmascript-code" include="uppercase.c"></pre>

<p>In addition to user reserved elements, Duktape keeps an automatic internal
value stack reserve to ensure all API calls have enough value stack space to
work without further allocations.  The value stack is also extended and shrunk
in somewhat large steps to minimize memory reallocation activity.  As a result
the internal number of value stack elements available beyond the caller
specified extra varies considerably.  The caller does not need to take this
into account and should never rely on any additional elements being available.</p>

<h3>Ecmascript array index</h3>

<p>Ecmascript object and array keys can only be strings.  Array indices
(e.g. 0, 1, 2) are represented as canonical string representations of the
respective numbers.  More technically, all canonical string representations
of the integers in the range [0, 2**32-1] are valid array indices.</p>

<p>To illustrate the Ecmascript array index handling, consider the following
example:</p>

<pre class="ecmascript-code">
var arr = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'quux' ];

print(arr[1]);     // refers to 'bar'
print(arr["1"]);   // refers to 'bar'

print(arr[1.0]);   // refers to 'bar', canonical encoding is "1"
print(arr["1.0"]); // undefined, not an array index
</pre>

<p>Some API calls operating on Ecmascript arrays accept numeric array index
arguments.  This is really just a short hand for denoting a string conversion
of that number.  For instance, if the API is given the integer 123, this
really refers to the property name "123".</p>

<p>Internally, Duktape tries to avoid converting numeric indices to actual
strings whenever possible, so it is preferable to use array index API calls
when they are relevant.  Similarly, when writing Ecmascript code it is
preferable to use numeric rather than string indices, as the same fast path
applies for Ecmascript code.</p>

<h3>Duktape API</h3>

<p>Duktape API is the collection of user callable API calls defined in
<code>duktape.h</code> and documented in the
<a href="api.html">API reference</a>.</p>

<p>The Duktape API calls are generally error tolerant and will check all
arguments for errors (such as <code>NULL</code> pointers).  However, to minimize
footprint, the <code>ctx</code> argument is not checked, and the caller MUST NOT
call any Duktape API calls with a <code>NULL</code> context.</p>

<h3>Duktape/C function</h3>

<p>A C function with a Duktape/C API signature can be associated with an
Ecmascript function object, and gets called when the Ecmascript function
object is called.  A Duktape/C API function looks as follows:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
int my_func(duk_context *ctx) {
    duk_push_int(ctx, 123);
    return 1;
}
</pre>

<p>The function gets Ecmascript call argument in the value stack of
<code>ctx</code>, with <code>duk_get_top(ctx)</code> indicating the number of
arguments present on the value stack.  When creating an Ecmascript function
object associated with a Duktape/C function, one can select the desired
number of arguments.  Extra arguments are dropped and missing arguments
are replaced with <code>undefined</code>.  A function can also be registered
as a vararg function (by giving <code>DUK_VARARGS</code> as the argument count)
in which case call arguments are not modified prior to C function entry.</p>

<p>The function can return one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return value 1 indicates that the value on the stack top is to be
    interpreted as a return value.</li>
<li>Return value 0 indicates that there is no explicit return value on
    the value stack; an <code>undefined</code> is returned to caller.</li>
<li>A negative return value indicates that an error is to be automatically
    thrown.  Error codes named <code>DUK_RET_xxx</code> map to specific kinds
    of errors (do not confuse these with <code>DUK_ERR_xxx</code> which are
    positive values).</li>
<li>A return value higher than 1 is currently undefined, as Ecmascript
    doesn't support multiple return values in Edition 5.1.  (Values higher
    than 1 may be taken into to support multiple return values in Ecmascript
    Edition 6.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A negative error return value is intended to simplify common error
handling, and is an alternative to constructing and throwing an error
explicitly with Duktape API calls.  No error message can be given; a
message is automatically constructed by Duktape.  For example:</p>

<pre class="c-code">
int my_func(duk_context *ctx) {
    if (duk_get_top(ctx) == 0) {
        /* throw TypeError if no arguments given */
        return DUK_RET_TYPE_ERROR;
    }
    /* ... */
}
</pre>

<p>All Duktape/C functions are considered <b>strict</b> in the
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-4.2.2">Ecmascript sense</a>.
For instance, attempt to delete a non-configurable property using <code>duk_del_prop()</code>
will cause an error to be thrown.  This is the case with a strict Ecmascript function too:</p>

<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function f() {
    'use strict';
    var arr = [1, 2, 3];
    return delete arr.length;  // array 'length' is non-configurable
}

print(f());  // this throws an error because f() is strict
</pre>

<p>As a consequence of Duktape/C function strictness, all Duktape API calls
made from inside a Duktape/C call obey Ecmascript strict semantics.  However,
when API calls are made from outside a Duktape/C function (when the call stack
is empty), all API calls obey Ecmascript <i>non-strict</i> semantics, as this
is the Ecmascript default.</p>

<p>Also as a consequence of Duktape/C function strictness, the <code>this</code>
binding given to Duktape/C functions is not
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-10.4.3">coerced</a>
as is normal for non-strict Ecmascript functions.  An example of how coercion
happens in Ecmascript code:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function strictFunc() { 'use strict'; print(typeof this); }
function nonStrictFunc() { print(typeof this); }

strictFunc.call('foo');     // prints 'string' (uncoerced)
nonStrictFunc.call('foo');  // prints 'object' (coerced)
</pre>

<p>Duktape/C functions are currently always <b>constructable</b>, i.e. they
can always be used in <code>new Foo()</code> expressions.  You can check whether
a function was called in constructor mode as follows:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
static int my_func(duk_context *ctx) {
    if (duk_is_constructor_call(ctx)) {
        printf("called as a constructor\n");
    } else {
        printf("called as a function\n");
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Storing state for a Duktape/C function</h3>

<p>Sometimes it would be nice to provide parameters or additional state
to a Duktape/C function out-of-band, i.e. outside explicit call arguments.
There are a few ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>First, a Duktape/C function can use its Function object to store state
or parameters.  A certain Duktape/C function (the actual C function)
is always represented by an Ecmascript Function object which is
magically associated with the underlying C function.   The Function
object can be used to store properties related to that particular
instance of the function.  Note that a certain Duktape/C function can
be associated with multiple independent Function objects and thus
independent states.</p>

<p>Accessing the Ecmascript Function object related to a Duktape/C function
is easy:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_push_current_function(ctx);
duk_get_prop_string(ctx, -1, "my_state_variable");
</pre>

<p>Another alternative for storing state is to call the Duktape/C function
as a method and then use the <code>this</code> binding for storing state.  For
instance, consider a Duktape/C function called as:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
foo.my_c_func()
</pre>

<p>When called, the Duktape/C function gets <code>foo</code> as its <code>this</code>
binding, and one could store state directly in <code>foo</code>.  The difference
to using the Function object approach is that the same object is shared by all
methods, which has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Accessing the <code>this</code> binding is easy:</p>
<pre class="c-code">
duk_push_this(ctx);
duk_get_prop_string(ctx, -1, "my_state_variable");
</pre>

<h3>Numeric error codes</h3>

<p>When errors are created or thrown using the Duktape API, the caller
must assign a numeric error code to the error.  Error codes are
positive integers, with a range restricted to 24 bits at the
moment: the allowed error number range is thus [1,16777215].  Built-in
error codes are defined in <code>duktape.h</code>, e.g. <code>DUK_ERR_TYPE_ERROR</code>.</p>

<p>The remaining high bits are used internally to carry e.g. additional
flags.  Negative error values are used in the Duktape/C API as a
shorthand to automatically throw an error.</p>
