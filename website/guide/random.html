<h1 id="random">Random numbers</h1>

<p>Random numbers are used internally for <code>Math.random()</code>.
They are also used currently for random pivot selection in the
<code>Array.prototype.sort()</code> implementation.</p>

<p>The default internal random number generator is optimized for a
low footprint.  It has a reasonable quality but won't pass stringent
statistical tests and is not at all suitable for cryptographic
applications.</p>

<p>You can replace the internal random number generator using the
<code>DUK_USE_GET_RANDOM_DOUBLE</code> config option.</p>
